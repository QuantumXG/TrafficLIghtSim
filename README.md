*Comprehensive Traffic Light Simulation in C*
A Beginner-Friendly Modular Project with Full Explanations

# Project Overview
In this project, we will build a Traffic Light Simulation in C, following modular programming principles for better organization, readability, and future scalability.

# Key Features:
✅ Three Light States: RED, YELLOW, GREEN
✅ Realistic Timing: Default durations (RED: 60s, GREEN: 40s, YELLOW: 5s)
✅ Modular Structure: Separates logic into different files
✅ User Interaction: Displays current state and remaining time
✅ Git Version Control: Tracks project history
